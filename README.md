# Canny edge detection

## Introduction
This repository contains code and resources related to Canny edge detection, a popular image processing technique used for detecting edges in images. The Canny edge detector is widely used in computer vision and image processing applications due to its effectiveness and robustness.

## Features
- Implementation of the Canny edge detection algorithm in Python
- Example scripts demonstrating how to use the Canny edge detector on images
- Comprehensive documentation and explanations of the Canny edge detection process

## Usage
The Canny edge detection algorithm is implemented in the `canny_edge_detection.py` file. You can use this file directly in your own projects or import it as a module.  Additionally, I've provide example scripts in the `canny_edge_detection.ipynb` file to demonstrate how to use the Canny edge detector on images.
